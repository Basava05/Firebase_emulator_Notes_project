# Notes Management System using Firebase Firestore (NoSQL)

This project is a DBMS-oriented mini project that demonstrates how a modern NoSQL database can be used to implement core database concepts such as CRUD operations, constraints (assertion-like validation), and triggers. The application is developed using Firebase Firestore and the Firebase Emulator Suite for local backend execution.

<br>

## Abstract

The Notes Management System allows users to create, view, update, and delete notes through a web-based interface. All data is stored in Firebase Firestore, which is a document-based NoSQL database. The project uses the Firebase Emulator Suite to safely simulate backend database operations on a local machine. Real-time data updates, validation using Firestore security rules, and automatic backend triggers using Cloud Functions are key features of this project.

<br>

## Introduction

Database Management Systems (DBMS) are essential for storing, managing, and retrieving data efficiently. Traditional relational databases use tables, rows, and columns, whereas NoSQL databases like Firestore use collections and documents.

This project explores how DBMS concepts can be implemented using a NoSQL approach. Firebase Firestore is used as the database, which stores data in collections and documents. The Firebase Emulator Suite is used to run Firestore, security rules, and triggers locally, making the project suitable for academic demonstrations.

## Project Architecture

The architecture of the project follows a client–server model.

## Why Firebase Firestore is NoSQL

Firebase Firestore is classified as a NoSQL database because:
<br>
- It stores data in collections and documents instead of tables and rows.
<br>
- It does not require a predefined schema.
<br>
- Each document can have different fields.
<br>
- Data is stored in a JSON-like document format.
<br>
- It supports real-time synchronization.

<br>

## Database Design

### Collections Used

### 1. notes
This collection stores user notes.

Fields:
<br>
- title (string)
<br>
- content (string)
<br>
- ownerId (string)
<br>
- createdAt (timestamp)
<br>
- updatedAt (timestamp)

<br>

### 2. auditLogs
This collection stores audit records generated by triggers.

Fields:
<br>
- action (string)
<br>
- noteId (string)
<br>
- ownerId (string)
<br>
- createdAt (timestamp)

<br>

## E-R Diagram Description (DBMS Style)

The system consists of three main entities:
<br>
- USER
<br>
- NOTE
<br>
- AUDIT_LOG

<br>

Each USER can create many NOTES (1:N relationship).
<br>
Each NOTE can generate multiple AUDIT_LOG entries through triggers (1:N relationship).

<br>

## CRUD Operations Implementation

### Create Operation

A new note is created using the `addDoc()` function. This corresponds to the INSERT operation in DBMS.

<br>

### Read Operation

Notes are retrieved using the `onSnapshot()` function, which listens for real-time changes. This corresponds to the SELECT operation in DBMS.

<br>

### Update Operation

Note content and title are modified using the `updateDoc()` function. This corresponds to the UPDATE operation in DBMS.

<br>

### Delete Operation

Notes are deleted using the `deleteDoc()` function. This corresponds to the DELETE operation in DBMS.

<br>

## Validation and Assertions

Firestore does not support SQL-style assertions. Instead, validation is implemented using Firestore Security Rules.

These rules ensure:
<br>
- Required fields are present
<br>
- Title is not empty
<br>
- Only the owner can update or delete a note

This serves the same purpose as assertions and constraints in traditional DBMS.

<br>

## Triggers Implementation

Triggers are implemented using Firebase Cloud Functions.

A trigger runs automatically whenever a new note is created in the `notes` collection. This trigger inserts a corresponding record into the `auditLogs` collection. This behavior is equivalent to database triggers in SQL.

<br>

## Firebase Emulator Suite

The Firebase Emulator Suite is used to run:
<br>
- Firestore Emulator (Database)
<br>
- Cloud Functions Emulator (Triggers)
<br>
- Emulator UI (Database Viewer)

The Emulator Suite allows the application to run fully on a local machine without sending data to production Firebase servers.
